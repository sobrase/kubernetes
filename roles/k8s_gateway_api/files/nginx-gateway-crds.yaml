              ancestors:
                description: |-
                  Ancestors is a list of ancestor resources (usually Gateways) that are
                  associated with the policy, and the status of the policy with respect to
                  each ancestor. When this policy attaches to a parent, the controller that
                  manages the parent and the ancestors MUST add an entry to this list when
                  the controller first sees the policy and SHOULD update the entry as
                  appropriate when the relevant ancestor is modified.

                  Note that choosing the relevant ancestor is left to the Policy designers;
                  an important part of Policy design is designing the right object level at
                  which to namespace this status.

                  Note also that implementations MUST ONLY populate ancestor status for
                  the Ancestor resources they are responsible for. Implementations MUST
                  use the ControllerName field to uniquely identify the entries in this list
                  that they are responsible for.

                  Note that to achieve this, the list of PolicyAncestorStatus structs
                  MUST be treated as a map with a composite key, made up of the AncestorRef
                  and ControllerName fields combined.

                  A maximum of 16 ancestors will be represented in this list. An empty list
                  means the Policy is not relevant for any ancestors.

                  If this slice is full, implementations MUST NOT add further entries.
                  Instead they MUST consider the policy unimplementable and signal that
                  on any related resources such as the ancestor that would be referenced
                  here. For example, if this list was full on BackendTLSPolicy, no
                  additional Gateways would be able to reference the Service targeted by
                  the BackendTLSPolicy.
                items:
                  description: |-
                    PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an
                    associated Ancestor.

                    Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it
                    in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the
                    Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and
                    the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most
                    useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations
                    SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers
                    have a _very_ good reason otherwise.

                    In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which
                    resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy
                    targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.

                    Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the
                    ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same
                    Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying
                    implementations.

                    For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is
                    used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.
                    In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the
                    ancestor object referred to in this status.

                    Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the
                    relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.

                    This struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map,
                    with a composite key made up of the AncestorRef and the ControllerName.

                            generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                            the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.

                            Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                            Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                            document how/if Port is interpreted.

                            For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                            long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                            namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                            from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                            attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                            the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                            SectionName is the name of a section within the target resource. In the
                            following resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:

                            * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                            are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                            both specified values.
                            * Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName

                            Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                            If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                            interpreted.

                            When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                            For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                            least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                            namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from
                            the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                            attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
                            Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

          NginxProxy is a configuration object that can be referenced from a GatewayClass parametersRef
          or a Gateway infrastructure.parametersRef. It provides a way to configure data plane settings.
          If referenced from a GatewayClass, the settings apply to all Gateways attached to the GatewayClass.
          If referenced from a Gateway, the settings apply to that Gateway alone. If both a Gateway and its GatewayClass
          reference an NginxProxy, the settings are merged. Settings specified on the Gateway NginxProxy override those
          set on the GatewayClass NginxProxy.

                                    When RecursiveReadOnly is set to IfPossible or to Enabled, MountPropagation must be None or unspecified

                                    RecursiveReadOnly specifies whether read-only mounts should be handled
                                    recursively.

                                    If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                    If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                                    recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                                    recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                                    field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                                    supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                                    an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                                    If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
                                    None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).

                                    If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                                    MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                    When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                    between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                    The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                    or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                    For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                    labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                    In this case, the global minimum is 1.

                                    |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                    - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                    scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                    violate MaxSkew(1).
                                    - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                    When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence

                                    When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                    Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                    And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                    this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                    As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                    scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                    If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                    Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                    When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                    For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                    labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                    | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                    |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                    The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                    In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                    because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                    it will violate MaxSkew.

                                    ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                    The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                    and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                    Use this if:
                                    a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                    b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                       tracking are needed,
                                    c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                    d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                       a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                       information on the connection between this volume type
                                       and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                    Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                    APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                    of an individual pod.

                                    Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                    be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                    more information.

                                    A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                    persistent volumes at the same time.
                                  properties:

                                        Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                        The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                        owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                        pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                        `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                        entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                        is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                        An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                        will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                        volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                        the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                        meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                        owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                        this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                        manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                                volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                                core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                                When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of

                                                provisioner.
                                                This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                                if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                                compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                                value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                                When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                                There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                  specified.
                                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                  in any namespaces.
                                                (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                                (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                                If unspecified and the PersistentVolumeClaim is unbound, the default VolumeAttributesClass
                                                will be set by the persistentvolume controller if it exists.
                                                If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will be

                                    image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                                    The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                                    - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                    - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                    - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                    The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                                    A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                                    The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                                    The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                                    The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                                    Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.
                                    The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                              Kubelet performs aggressive normalization of the PEM contents written
                                              into the pod filesystem.  Esoteric PEM features such as inter-block
                                              comments and block headers are stripped.  Certificates are deduplicated.
                                              The ordering of certificates within the file is arbitrary, and Kubelet
                                              may change the order over time.

                                  preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                  container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                  PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                  container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                  period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                  or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                    between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                    The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                    or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                    For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                    labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:

                                    - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                    scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)

                                    Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                    And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                    this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                    As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                    scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                    If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                    Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                    When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                    For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                    labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                    | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                    |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                    The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                    In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                    because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                    it will violate MaxSkew.

                                    pod topology spread skew. Options are:

                                    has a toleration, are included.
                                    - Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included.

                                    If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy.

                                    TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key
                                    and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
                                    We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                                    of pods into each bucket.
                                    We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                                    Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
                                    nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                                    e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
                                    And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology.

                                    WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy
                                    the spread constraint.
                                    - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
                                    - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
                                      but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                                      skew.
                                    A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                                    if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                                    "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                                    For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                    labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
                                    | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                    | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                                    If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                                    to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                                    MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                                    won't make it *more* imbalanced.

                                       and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                    Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                    APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                    of an individual pod.

                                    Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                    be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                    more information.

                                    A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                    persistent volumes at the same time.
                                  properties:

                                        Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                        The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                        owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                        pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                        `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                        entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                        is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                        An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                        will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                        volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                        the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                        meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                        owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                        this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                        manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                                dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                                volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                                core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                                When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of

                                                provisioner.
                                                This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                                if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                                compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                                value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                                When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                                There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                  specified.
                                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                  in any namespaces.
                                                (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                                (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                    image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                                    The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                                    - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                    - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                    - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                    The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                                    A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                                    The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                                    The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                                    The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                                    Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.
                                    The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                        IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                                        Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                      - ProxyProtocol: NGINX will rewrite the client's IP using the PROXY protocol header.

                      If disabled, NGINX will select the IP at the end of the array.

              ancestors:
                description: |-
                  Ancestors is a list of ancestor resources (usually Gateways) that are
                  associated with the policy, and the status of the policy with respect to
                  each ancestor. When this policy attaches to a parent, the controller that
                  manages the parent and the ancestors MUST add an entry to this list when
                  the controller first sees the policy and SHOULD update the entry as
                  appropriate when the relevant ancestor is modified.

                  Note that choosing the relevant ancestor is left to the Policy designers;
                  an important part of Policy design is designing the right object level at
                  which to namespace this status.

                  Note also that implementations MUST ONLY populate ancestor status for
                  the Ancestor resources they are responsible for. Implementations MUST
                  use the ControllerName field to uniquely identify the entries in this list
                  that they are responsible for.

                  Note that to achieve this, the list of PolicyAncestorStatus structs
                  MUST be treated as a map with a composite key, made up of the AncestorRef
                  and ControllerName fields combined.

                  A maximum of 16 ancestors will be represented in this list. An empty list
                  means the Policy is not relevant for any ancestors.

                  If this slice is full, implementations MUST NOT add further entries.
                  Instead they MUST consider the policy unimplementable and signal that
                  on any related resources such as the ancestor that would be referenced
                  here. For example, if this list was full on BackendTLSPolicy, no
                  additional Gateways would be able to reference the Service targeted by
                  the BackendTLSPolicy.
                items:
                  description: |-
                    PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an
                    associated Ancestor.

                    Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it
                    in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the
                    Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and
                    the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most
                    useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations
                    SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers
                    have a _very_ good reason otherwise.

                    In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which
                    resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy
                    targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.

                    Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the
                    ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same
                    Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying
                    implementations.

                    For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is
                    used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.
                    In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the
                    ancestor object referred to in this status.

                    Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the
                    relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.

                    This struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map,
                    with a composite key made up of the AncestorRef and the ControllerName.

                            Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                            generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                            For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                            long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,

                            * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                            are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                            both specified values.

                            Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                            If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is

                            For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                            least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                            namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from

                            Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                description: |-
                  Ancestors is a list of ancestor resources (usually Gateways) that are
                  associated with the policy, and the status of the policy with respect to
                  each ancestor. When this policy attaches to a parent, the controller that
                  manages the parent and the ancestors MUST add an entry to this list when
                  the controller first sees the policy and SHOULD update the entry as
                  appropriate when the relevant ancestor is modified.

                  Note that choosing the relevant ancestor is left to the Policy designers;
                  an important part of Policy design is designing the right object level at
                  which to namespace this status.

                  Note also that implementations MUST ONLY populate ancestor status for
                  the Ancestor resources they are responsible for. Implementations MUST
                  use the ControllerName field to uniquely identify the entries in this list
                  that they are responsible for.

                  Note that to achieve this, the list of PolicyAncestorStatus structs
                  MUST be treated as a map with a composite key, made up of the AncestorRef
                  and ControllerName fields combined.

                  A maximum of 16 ancestors will be represented in this list. An empty list
                  means the Policy is not relevant for any ancestors.

                  If this slice is full, implementations MUST NOT add further entries.
                  Instead they MUST consider the policy unimplementable and signal that
                  on any related resources such as the ancestor that would be referenced
                  here. For example, if this list was full on BackendTLSPolicy, no
                  additional Gateways would be able to reference the Service targeted by
                  the BackendTLSPolicy.
                items:
                  description: |-
                    PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an
                    associated Ancestor.

                    Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it
                    in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the
                    Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and
                    the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most
                    useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations
                    SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers
                    have a _very_ good reason otherwise.

                    In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which
                    resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy
                    targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.

                    Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the
                    ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same
                    Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying
                    implementations.

                    For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is
                    used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.
                    In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the
                    ancestor object referred to in this status.

                    Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the
                    relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.

                    This struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map,
                    with a composite key made up of the AncestorRef and the ControllerName.

                            Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                            boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                            allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                            Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                            generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                            ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"

                            ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                            "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                            connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                            the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                            ParentRef of the Route.

                            as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port

                description: |-
                  Ancestors is a list of ancestor resources (usually Gateways) that are
                  associated with the policy, and the status of the policy with respect to
                  each ancestor. When this policy attaches to a parent, the controller that
                  manages the parent and the ancestors MUST add an entry to this list when
                  the controller first sees the policy and SHOULD update the entry as
                  appropriate when the relevant ancestor is modified.

                  Note that choosing the relevant ancestor is left to the Policy designers;
                  an important part of Policy design is designing the right object level at
                  which to namespace this status.

                  Note also that implementations MUST ONLY populate ancestor status for
                  the Ancestor resources they are responsible for. Implementations MUST
                  use the ControllerName field to uniquely identify the entries in this list
                  that they are responsible for.

                  Note that to achieve this, the list of PolicyAncestorStatus structs
                  MUST be treated as a map with a composite key, made up of the AncestorRef
                  and ControllerName fields combined.

                  A maximum of 16 ancestors will be represented in this list. An empty list
                  means the Policy is not relevant for any ancestors.

                  If this slice is full, implementations MUST NOT add further entries.
                  Instead they MUST consider the policy unimplementable and signal that
                  on any related resources such as the ancestor that would be referenced
                  here. For example, if this list was full on BackendTLSPolicy, no
                  additional Gateways would be able to reference the Service targeted by
                  the BackendTLSPolicy.
                items:
                  description: |-
                    PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an
                    associated Ancestor.

                    Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it
                    in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the
                    Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and
                    the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most
                    useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations
                    SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers
                    have a _very_ good reason otherwise.

                    In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which
                    resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy
                    targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.

                    Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the
                    ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same
                    Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying
                    implementations.

                    For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is
                    used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.
                    In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the
                    ancestor object referred to in this status.

                    Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the
                    relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.

                    This struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map,
                    with a composite key made up of the AncestorRef and the ControllerName.

                            boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                            allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                            Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                            generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.
